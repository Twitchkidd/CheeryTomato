# CheeryTomato

A 'pomodoro' app, the name being a play on "cherry tomato," the translation from Italian of 'pomodorino,' what I always think of when I hear 'pomodoro' because it's the name of a favorite family restaurant from my childhood. Good luck!

Custom fonts React Native: create /assets/fonts/, write the rnpm bit in package.json, make sure the fonts are named their PostScript name, react-native link ./assets/fonts, then the font name is accessible to fontFamily:String

SVG transform in React Native: yarn add --dev react-native-svg-tranformer and yarn add or yarn add --dev react-native-svg, I did add --dev, edit metro.config.js (I don't know if that's correct, I think maybe,) and then use the imported component instead of Image source={{}}

Debugging: I don't even KNOW!! sudo npm i -g react-native-debugger-open and ran rndebugger-open and then tried it, and it ... didn't throw an error?
